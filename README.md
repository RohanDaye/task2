Initialization:

The program starts by importing the Scanner class for user input.
Input:

The user is asked to input the number of subjects.
Subject Marks Input and Calculation:

A for loop is used to iterate through each subject, prompting the user to enter the marks for each subject. The total marks are calculated during this process.
Average Percentage Calculation:

The average percentage is calculated based on the total marks and the number of subjects.
Grade Calculation:

The calculateGrade method takes the average percentage as a parameter and returns the corresponding grade based on a predefined grading scale.
Output:

The program then prints the total marks, average percentage, and the calculated grade.
Pass/Fail Information:

Additional information is provided about passing or failing the exam based on whether the grade is "F" (fail) or not.
Resource Closing:

The Scanner is closed to prevent resource leaks.
